    '''The reason The Batman's plot is great is that it balances action and drama perfectly. While there are plenty of high-octane fight scenes and thrilling action sequences, the story also takes the time to delve into its characters' emotional and psychological struggles.''',
    "Guardians of the Galaxy, a film based on the Abnett and Lanning run, was released to widespread popular and critical acclaim in 2014; a sequel followed in 2017.",
    '''About the Kryptonian superhero, the chatbot said: “Objectively speaking, Superman is stronger than Batman. Superman has a wide range of superhuman abilities, including super strength, speed, flight, invulnerability, and heat vision. In a straight-up fight, Superman would almost certainly defeat Batman.”''',
    '''As part of a multi-year deal between Sony Pictures and the service, Across the Spider-Verse's first streaming destination will be Netflix. The streamer holds the rights to all Sony's new movies in the first 18 months of the Pay 1 window, meaning the period after the theatrical and home release windows.''',
